React is one of the most popular front-end libraries in the world used by websites such as Facebook, Instagram, Yahoo Mail, Dropbox, and more. 

Coupled with Tailwind CSS and the components from Flowbite you will be able to develop applications faster than ever.

## Install Tailwind CSS with React

Follow the next steps to install Tailwind CSS and Flowbite with Create React App.

1. Run the following command in your terminal to create a React application, if you don't already have one:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-project
cd my-project
```

2. Install Tailwind CSS by running the following two commands:

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

3. Configure the template paths inside the `tailwind.config.js` file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

4. Set up the Tailwind directives inside the `./src/index.css` file:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

5. Install Flowbite by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install flowbite
```

6. Require Flowbite as a plugin inside your `tailwind.config.js` file:

```javascript
module.exports = {

    plugins: [
        require('flowbite/plugin')
    ]

}
```

7. Import the Flowbite JavaScript file inside your main `index.js` file:

```bash
import 'flowbite';
```

8. Additionally to your own `content` data you should add `flowbite` to apply the classes from the interactive elements in the `tailwind.config.js` file:

```javascript
module.exports = {

    content: [
        "./node_modules/flowbite/**/*.js"
    ]

}
```

Now you can start the server by running `npm run start` or build the project using `npm run build`.

## Flowbite components

Most of the components from Flowbite will work as long as you have Tailwind CSS included in your project. The interactive elements such as dropdowns, tooltips, and modals will work based on the data attributes that you can code directly in your view files, except when using a routing system like React Router. 

We are currently working on a standalone React component library to make integration with React fully compatible and with frameworks such as NextJS.

You can start using the components from Flowbite inside your React project by only changing the `class` attributes to `className`. 

Here's an example of a modal component that you can add inside your `App.js` file:

```javascript
import './App.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <button className="block text-white bg-blue-700 hover:bg-blue-800 focus:ring-4 focus:ring-blue-300 font-medium rounded-lg text-sm px-5 py-2.5 text-center dark:bg-blue-600 dark:hover:bg-blue-700 dark:focus:ring-blue-800" type="button" data-modal-toggle="default-modal">
        Toggle modal
      </button>

      <div id="default-modal" aria-hidden="true" className="hidden overflow-y-auto overflow-x-hidden fixed right-0 left-0 top-4 z-50 justify-center items-center h-modal md:h-full md:inset-0">
        <div className="relative px-4 w-full max-w-2xl h-full md:h-auto">

          <div className="relative bg-white rounded-lg shadow dark:bg-gray-700">

            <div className="flex justify-between items-start p-5 rounded-t border-b dark:border-gray-600">
